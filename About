Road Safety in todayâ€™s context is the most significant issue which relates to the safety of public on road. Millions of lives are lost annually throughout the world due to road accidents, resulting in huge loss of finance and resources for individuals as well as for the nation. Every year governments throughout the world spend billions on the treatment and welfare of accident victims and their rescue, if they are lucky enough to make it alive. There is an urgent need to make people more aware about road safety precautions and why they matter so much. Strict laws must also be implemented to enforce road safety norms.
